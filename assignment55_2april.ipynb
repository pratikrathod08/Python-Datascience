It occurs when there is unintentional access to information that would not be available in a real-world deployment scenario, leading to over-optimistic performance estimates.\n",

    "Imagine you are building a credit card fraud detection model. During feature engineering, you accidentally include the transaction timestamp as a feature. The timestamp contains information about the future, which would not be available in real-time scenarios. Consequently, the model may learn to rely on this feature and achieve high accuracy during training and evaluation. However, in deployment, the model would fail to perform well as it cannot rely on future timestamps to predict fraud."
