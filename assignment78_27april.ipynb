    "Types of Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) K-means: Divides data into non-overlapping clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. Assumes clusters are spherical and of equal size.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Hierarchical Clustering: Forms a tree-like structure of nested clusters, either agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down). Does not require specifying the number of clusters beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN): Groups together data points in dense areas, separated by less dense areas. It can discover clusters of arbitrary shape and is insensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): Assumes that data points are generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, allowing for probabilistic clustering and handling data with complex distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Agglomerative Clustering: Starts with each data point as a separate cluster and iteratively merges them based on similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "f) Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM): Similar to K-means but uses medoids (actual data points) as representatives of clusters instead of means."

    "K-means is a popular partition-based clustering algorithm that divides a dataset into K clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean. The steps are as follows:\n",

    "Randomly initialize K points as cluster centroids.\n",
    "Assign each data point to the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.\n",

    "Simple and easy to understand and implement.\n",

    "Assumes clusters are spherical and equally sized, which is not always the case.\n",
    "Struggles with non-linear and complex data distributions.\n",
    "Prone to being affected by outliers, which can significantly impact cluster results."

    "Choosing the right K value is crucial. Some common methods to determine the optimal number of clusters are:\n",

    "a) Elbow Method: Plot the variance (or squared error) against different K values and look for the \"elbow point,\" where the rate of decrease slows down, suggesting the optimal K.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Silhouette Score: Measure the compactness and separation of clusters. Higher scores indicate better-defined clusters.\n",

    "a) Sensitive to Initial Centroid Placement: To mitigate this, run K-means multiple times with different initializations and select the best result based on evaluation metrics.\n",
