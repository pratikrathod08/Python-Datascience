    "Object Detection: \n",
    "Object detection is the task of locating and classifying objects within an image or video frame. It not only identifies what objects are present but also where they are located. In object detection, multiple objects can be detected and located simultaneously in an image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Classification:\n",
    "Object classification, on the other hand, involves assigning a label or category to a specific object within an image. It does not provide information about the object's location in the image, only its class. Unlike object detection, object classification focuses on recognizing and categorizing individual objects without considering their spatial arrangement."

Each pixel has specific spatial relationships with neighboring pixels, forming a structured grid that represents the image. In the context of deep learning, this structured nature allows convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract meaningful patterns and features from images by analyzing local and global pixel relationships."

These convolutional layers are followed by activation functions and pooling layers, such as max pooling, which reduces spatial dimensions while retaining essential information.

Through this process, CNNs learn hierarchical representations of features, enabling them to understand complex patterns and objects in images."
