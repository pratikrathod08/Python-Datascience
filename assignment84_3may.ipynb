    "Feature selection plays a crucial role in anomaly detection for the following reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality Reduction: Anomaly detection often deals with high-dimensional data, and not all features may be relevant for identifying anomalies. Feature selection helps reduce the dimensionality, making the algorithm more efficient and effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Improved Performance: Irrelevant or redundant features can introduce noise and negatively impact the performance of anomaly detection algorithms. Selecting only the most informative features can improve the accuracy and robustness of the detection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoiding Overfitting: Including too many features, especially in small datasets, can lead to overfitting, where the algorithm may memorize the noise in the data rather than learning general patterns. Feature selection mitigates the risk of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretability: Selecting important features can provide insights into the characteristics of anomalies, making it easier to understand and interpret the results."

    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a density-based clustering algorithm. It groups data points that are close to each other in high-density regions and marks points in low-density regions as outliers (noise). The key idea behind DBSCAN is to find regions with a sufficient number of data points, known as \"core points,\" and expand these regions to include directly or indirectly reachable points.\n",

    "Choose a random data point and find all its neighbors within a specified distance (epsilon).\n",
