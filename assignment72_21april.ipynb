    "Less sensitive to differences in feature scales.\n",
    "The choice of distance metric can affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor. If the features have different scales, using Euclidean distance may prioritize features with larger scales. In such cases, feature scaling becomes crucial to ensure fair distance calculations. Additionally, the choice of distance metric depends on the nature of the data and the problem. For example, Manhattan distance might be more appropriate when features represent categorical variables or when the spatial relationship between features resembles a grid-like structure."

    "K: The number of nearest neighbors to consider. A higher value of K smooths decision boundaries but may lead to the loss of local patterns, while a lower value of K may make the model more sensitive to noise and outliers.

    "Some potential drawbacks of using KNN as a classifier or regressor include:\n",

    "Computational complexity: KNN can be computationally expensive, especially with large datasets or high-dimensional feature spaces. The search for nearest neighbors requires comparing distances to all training instances.\n",
