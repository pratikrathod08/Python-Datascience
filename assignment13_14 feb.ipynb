    "** Advantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved performance: Multithreading allows multiple threads to execute concurrently, thus making efficient use of available resources and improving overall program performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Responsiveness: By separating time-consuming tasks into separate threads, the main thread can remain responsive to user input or other events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Resource sharing: Multithreading can allow multiple threads to share common resources such as memory, files, and network connections, which can reduce the overall resource consumption of a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Modularity: Multithreading can make it easier to break down a program into smaller, more manageable modules that can be developed and tested independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Disadvantages of Multithreading:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complexity: Multithreading can make the program more complex, as it requires careful synchronization of shared resources to avoid race conditions and other synchronization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Debugging: Multithreading can make debugging more difficult, as it can be hard to reproduce race conditions and other timing-dependent bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Overhead: Creating and managing threads has some overhead, so creating too many threads can actually reduce performance and increase resource consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Deadlocks: If threads are not synchronized properly, it can result in deadlocks where two or more threads are waiting for each other to release shared resources, causing the program to become unresponsive."

    "Deadlock:\n",
    "Deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, waiting for each other to release shared resources that they need to continue execution. This can happen when two or more threads acquire locks on shared resources in different orders, and then try to acquire locks on the same resources again without releasing the ones they hold. This can cause a \"deadly embrace\" where each thread is waiting for the other to release the resource they need, resulting in a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition:\n",
    "Race condition is a situation where two or more threads access a shared resource simultaneously, resulting in unpredictable and potentially incorrect behavior. This can happen when multiple threads try to modify the same variable or object without proper synchronization, which can cause data inconsistencies and other unexpected results. A race condition occurs when the final outcome of the program depends on the order in which threads execute, which is not deterministic."
