    "Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method based on decision trees used for regression tasks. It combines multiple decision trees to create a robust and accurate regression model. Each decision tree is trained on a different subset of the training data and features, and the final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all the individual trees."

    "Random Forest Regressor reduces the risk of overfitting through two key mechanisms:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Random subspace sampling: In the training process, each decision tree in the random forest is trained on a random subset of the features rather than using all the features. This sampling introduces diversity and reduces the likelihood of individual trees overfitting to specific features or noise in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Ensemble averaging: The final prediction of the random forest is obtained by averaging the predictions of all the individual trees. This ensemble averaging helps to smooth out the individual errors and reduces the variance of the model. By combining multiple trees, the random forest can provide a more generalized and robust prediction."

    "Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by averaging. Once the individual decision trees are trained on different subsets of the data, each tree predicts the target value for a given input. In the case of regression, the predictions of the individual trees are averaged to obtain the final prediction of the random forest. The averaging process helps to reduce the impact of outliers or noisy predictions from individual trees."
