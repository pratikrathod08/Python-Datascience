    "A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model. It compares the predicted classes (labels) from the model with the true classes (ground truth) of the data. The matrix is often represented in a tabular format with rows corresponding to the true classes and columns corresponding to the predicted classes.\n",

    "A typical confusion matrix for a binary classification problem has four entries:\n",
    "\n",
    "True Positives (TP): The number of instances that are correctly predicted as positive (class 1).\n",
    "False Positives (FP): The number of instances that are incorrectly predicted as positive when they are actually negative (class 0).\n",
    "True Negatives (TN): The number of instances that are correctly predicted as negative (class 0).\n",
    "False Negatives (FN): The number of instances that are incorrectly predicted as negative when they are actually positive (class 1).\n",
    "By analyzing the values in the contingency matrix, various classification metrics can be calculated, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc., which provide insights into the model's performance."

    "A pair confusion matrix is an extension of the regular confusion matrix that is used in multi-class classification tasks. In a multi-class problem with N classes, a regular confusion matrix is an N x N matrix, where each element (i, j) represents the number of instances of class i that are predicted as class j.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, a pair confusion matrix is an N x N matrix, where each element (i, j) represents the number of instances of class i that are correctly predicted as class j. In other words, each row in the pair confusion matrix sums to 1, indicating the proportion of instances of class i that were correctly classified as class j.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pair confusion matrices are useful in situations where we want to focus on the pairwise relationships between classes and assess how well the model discriminates between different pairs of classes. It allows us to analyze the confusion patterns for each class and understand which classes are often confused with each other."

    "In the context of natural language processing (NLP), an extrinsic measure is an evaluation metric that assesses the performance of a language model on a downstream task that utilizes language understanding or generation. Unlike intrinsic measures that evaluate the model's performance on intermediate tasks (e.g., perplexity for language modeling), extrinsic measures evaluate the model's performance in real-world applications.\n",

    "For example, in NLP, an extrinsic measure could involve evaluating a language model's performance on tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, machine translation, question answering, etc. The extrinsic measure provides insights into how well the language model performs when applied to practical tasks and how it can contribute to solving real-world problems."
