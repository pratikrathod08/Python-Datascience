    "Boosting is a machine learning ensemble technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner. It is a sequential process where each weak learner is trained to correct the mistakes made by the previous weak learners. By iteratively adjusting the weights of training instances, boosting focuses on difficult-to-classify examples, improving the overall performance of the model."

    "Increasing the number of estimators (weak learners) in the AdaBoost algorithm can have both positive and negative effects:\n",

    "Positive effect: Adding more estimators generally leads to improved performance. As the number of weak learners increases, the model can better capture complex patterns in the data and reduce bias, potentially leading to higher accuracy.\n",

    "Negative effect: Increasing the number of estimators beyond a certain point may cause overfitting. The model may start to memorize the training data, resulting in decreased performance on unseen data. Overfitting can occur if the weak learners become too complex or if the number of iterations becomes excessively large.\n",

It is crucial to find the right balance between model complexity and generalization to achieve optimal performance.
