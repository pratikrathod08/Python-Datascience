    "The decision tree classifier algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It builds a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. The algorithm works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Selection: The algorithm selects the best feature from the dataset to split the data based on certain criteria, such as information gain or Gini impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting: It splits the dataset into subsets based on the selected feature's values. Each subset represents a branch or node in the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursion: The algorithm recursively repeats the splitting process on each subset until a stopping criterion is met. This criterion could be reaching a maximum tree depth, achieving a minimum number of samples in a leaf node, or other conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaf Node Assignment: Once the splitting process is completed, the algorithm assigns a class label to each leaf node based on the majority class in that node.\n",
    "\n",

    "Gini Impurity: The decision tree algorithm uses a measure called Gini impurity to evaluate the quality of a split. Gini impurity measures the degree of impurity in a node or subset of data. A Gini impurity of 0 indicates a pure node with only one class, while a Gini impurity of 1 indicates an impure node with an equal distribution of classes.\n",

    "Splitting Criteria: The algorithm calculates the Gini impurity for each feature and its possible split points. It selects the feature and split point that results in the lowest Gini impurity after the split.\n",

The decision boundary splits the feature space into two regions, each associated with a different class. This splitting process continues recursively until leaf nodes are reached, which represent the predicted class labels.\n",
