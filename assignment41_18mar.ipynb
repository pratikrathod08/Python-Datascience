    "The Filter method in feature selection is a technique that ranks features based on their statistical properties and relevance to the target variable. It involves applying statistical measures to each feature independently and selecting the top-ranked features. The Filter method does not consider the interaction between features or the specific learning algorithm used. Examples of filter methods include correlation-based feature selection, chi-square test, and information gain."

    "The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates the performance of the learning algorithm using different subsets of features. It selects features based on their impact on the predictive performance of the model. The Wrapper method uses a specific learning algorithm to assess the quality of feature subsets by training and evaluating the model iteratively. It takes into account the interaction between features and is computationally more expensive compared to the Filter method."

    "Inability to handle redundant features: If multiple features are highly correlated, the Filter method may select all of them, leading to redundancy in the feature set.\n",
