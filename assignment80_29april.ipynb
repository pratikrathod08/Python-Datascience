    "Basic concept of clustering and examples of applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning technique used to group similar data points together into clusters based on their intrinsic characteristics or similarities. The goal of clustering is to find natural groupings within the data, where data points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters. Clustering is useful in various applications, including:\n",

    "Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers with similar preferences for targeted marketing strategies.\n",

One common approach is to use data visualization techniques (e.g., scatter plots) to visually inspect the data's density and determine suitable values. Alternatively, techniques like the k-distance graph or the elbow method can be employed to find appropriate epsilon and minimum points values."

In high-dimensional spaces, the distance between data points tends to become more uniform, making it harder to distinguish meaningful clusters from noise. Feature selection or dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA can help mitigate this issue."
