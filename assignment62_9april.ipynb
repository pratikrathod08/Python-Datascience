    "Bayes' theorem is used in practice in various fields, including statistics, machine learning, and data science. It is applied to update the probability of a hypothesis or event based on new evidence. In practice, Bayes' theorem allows us to incorporate prior knowledge or beliefs about an event and update those beliefs based on observed data, leading to more accurate predictions or estimates."

    "Bayes' theorem is closely related to conditional probability. It provides a way to calculate the conditional probability of an event based on prior knowledge or evidence. The theorem states that the posterior probability of an event given some evidence is proportional to the prior probability of the event and the likelihood of the evidence given the event. In other words, Bayes' theorem connects prior probabilities and conditional probabilities, enabling the updating of beliefs or probabilities based on new information."
