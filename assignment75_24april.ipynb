    "A projection is the process of transforming data from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional subspace while preserving the most important information. In PCA (Principal Component Analysis), the projection is performed to find the principal components that represent the directions of maximum variance in the data. These principal components are orthogonal (uncorrelated) and serve as new coordinate axes in the lower-dimensional space."

    "In PCA, the optimization problem aims to find the principal components that explain the maximum variance in the data. The first principal component is the direction that captures the most variance, the second principal component is orthogonal to the first and captures the second most variance, and so on. Mathematically, the optimization problem involves finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (or correlation matrix) of the data. The eigenvectors are the principal components, and the corresponding eigenvalues represent the amount of variance explained by each component."
