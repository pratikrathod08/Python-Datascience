    "Regularization in logistic regression is used to prevent overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too complex and fits the training data too closely, leading to poor generalization to unseen data.\n",

    "L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the squared values of the coefficients. It encourages smaller weights for all features, effectively reducing the impact of less important features."
